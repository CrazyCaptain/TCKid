<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #800000;"><strong><span style="font-family: &#39;Book Antiqua&#39;, Palatino; font-size: 18pt;">By TCKid </span></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;Book Antiqua&#39;, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;">In the process of researching and pulling together information for this year in review, I discovered that our voices within the <a href="http://tckid.com/what-is-a-tck.html">Third Culture Kid</a> (TCK) or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/cross-cultural-kids-everywhere/norma-mccaig-has-passed-away/50153600618">global nomad</a> and cross culture community have added more color to the canvas of our identity. &nbsp;The diversity of backgrounds, opinions, concerns, and experiences within the tribe have begun to become more visible or vocal. &nbsp;We have begun to move beyond the standard scripts about matters that continue to be close to our hearts: We have moved into discussing social concerns and human experiences and brought them back into the fold of how we experience them as TCKs or cross cultural individuals. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;Book Antiqua&#39;, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;">We have demonstrated that global mobility and cross cultural navigation will always influence how we experience life on some level. &nbsp;However, we also fear, cry about and are vulnerable to, as well as celebrate, enjoy and rejoice at, the same things as individuals who grew up in one town. &nbsp; We bleed, hurt, can be flawed and are mortal as any other human beings. &nbsp;We just have the unshakable context of cultural or geographic mobility. &nbsp;We find our strengths to overcome challenges through the mobility that made us who we are and when we get up to stand, speak out or do something, we change things around us. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;Book Antiqua&#39;, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;">We speak, write and create out of being in between worlds, but we also share some experiences with the rest of the world. &nbsp;We navigate community, academia, human services, and private enterprise out of being from nowhere and everywhere, but we have also established a niche securely anchored to our tribe's deep roots and history. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;Book Antiqua&#39;, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;">I hope you enjoy reading through these highlights of first times, milestones and significant events from 2014, which continue the history of our tribe. &nbsp;If a story or event was not mentioned or overlooked, it definitely does not reflect its significance for the tribe. &nbsp;I wish to thank all who took the time to contribute their stories and Erin Sinogba for her assistance. &nbsp;Many of the stories, discovered in the research for this article, were very eye-opening for me and I hope you will find them valuable as well. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;Book Antiqua&#39;, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;">Thank you all for being you and making our tribe look simply human, beautiful, powerful.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: &#39;Book Antiqua&#39;, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;">In January, Actress and writer&nbsp;<a href="http://cargocollective.com/ElizabethLiangSoloShowandWriter/About-Elizabeth-Liang">&nbsp;<strong>Elizabeth Liang</strong></a><strong>'s show, <em><a href="http://cargocollective.com/aliencitizen">Alien Citizen: an earth odyssey</a></em></strong>, a play about being "from everywhere and nowhere," starts to make its rounds at colleges, starting with California State University â€“ Los Angeles, followed by Princeton and M.I.T. in February and Wesleyan, Williams and other colleges the rest of the year. &nbsp;Liang also starts touring internationally in Iceland and Panama and keynotes for <a href="http://www.figt.org/2014_keynotes#ClosingKeynote">Families in Global Transition</a>&nbsp;(FIGT)&nbsp;in March. &nbsp;Aside from the global nomad identity, <a href="http://www.hapahappyhour.libsyn.com/">Liang also addresses mixed race topics </a>in the show, which she performs at the&nbsp;Critical Mixed Race Studies conference at DePaul University in Chicago in November. &nbsp;According to Liang,</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-family: &#39;Book Antiqua&#39;, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;">Something about the learned role of the outsider seems to strike a chord, even in people who I would not expect to relate to that. &nbsp;This has been a joyous and humbling discoveryâ€¦and a reminder of lessons I learned while growing up as a TCK: we all have more in common than we know. &nbsp;My dream is to take the show to festivals and international schools worldwide.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;Book Antiqua&#39;, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="http://www.tv.com/people/elizabeth-liang-1/">Liang has appeared in television shows</a>, "The West Wing",&nbsp;"Law and Order: Los Angeles", "Frasier", "Felicity", and other TV shows and movies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: &#39;Book Antiqua&#39;, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;">In February, <a href="http://thejakartaglobe.beritasatu.com/news/yogyakarta-beset-by-ash-awaits-cleansing-rains/" target="_blank"><strong>Jakarta Globe</strong> reports on the effects of the thick ash that covered Yogyakarta after Mt Elud's eruption </a>in east Java and<strong> features the photo of Ardi Kuhn</strong>, a TCK who was once one of TCKid's local group leaders. &nbsp;Kuhn is a <a href="http://kakiseni.com/events/seronok/">sound and visual artist</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AE1aDAqnwao">web developer and works as a teacher</a> in Java.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: &#39;Book Antiqua&#39;, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;"><strong><a href="http://www.babble.com/home/">Babble</a>,</strong> a Disney sponsored family-centered online lifestyle magazine, publishes an article written by TCK <strong>Rachel Pieh Jones</strong> in February on, &nbsp;<a href="http://www.babble.com/babble-voices/sexual-harassment-and-third-culture-kids/">The Conversation We're Not Having<strong>: Sexual Harassment and Third Culture Kids</strong>&nbsp;</a>. &nbsp; In the article, <a href="http://www.djiboutijones.com/about/">Jones</a> confronts how expat adults and teens experience sexual harassment and discusses the importance of taking about the problem. &nbsp;Jones points out, "While sexual harassment is <i>always</i> awful, shaming, and wrong, experiencing it as a foreigner carries the added dimension of isolation and uncertainty and experiencing it as a foreign <em>kid</em> is especially traumatic." &nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-family: &#39;Book Antiqua&#39;, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;">Jones herself has experienced sexual harassment herself as an expat. &nbsp;In her <a href="http://www.djiboutijones.com/2013/09/the-story-women-need-to-tell/">September 2013 Djibouti Jones blog article</a>, Jones states, &nbsp;I listen to the stories of the women around me. And I say, <i>me too. That happened to me too.</i> I tell my story, I don't hide it because it is embarrassing, because my reaction wasn't what I wish it were. I hear the women around me say, <i>me too.</i> And say, <i>I'm sorry.</i> And say, <i>I'm angry with you, for you.</i> I believe we are the walking wounded. Yes, we are wounded, but yes, we are walking forward, out the front door.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;Book Antiqua&#39;, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;">Jones' TCK and expat related work also appears in other publications, such as <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/thisisourcity/7thcity/you-cant-consume-your-way-to-social-justice.html#comments">Christianity Today</a>, and the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/fashion/a-gift-from-allah-modern-love.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0">New York Times</a>. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: &#39;Book Antiqua&#39;, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Heidi Tunberg</strong>, a TCK who works with TCKs and loves collecting resources and information about the Third Culture experience starts creating <strong><a href="http://www.pinterest.com/heidinindi/">TCK-themed boards on Pinterest</a></strong> around February. &nbsp;"I discovered Pinterest was a perfect place to organize my collections to make them accessible to othersâ€¦. I created 17 TCK-themed boards spotlighting books by and for TCKs, TCK-themed movies and videos, articles &amp; blog posts, famous TCKs, fun items, quotes and memes for TCKs, and more." &nbsp;Tunberg welcomes suggestions for any material to add to her TCK-themed Pinterest boards. &nbsp;</span></p>

<blockquote><p><span style="font-family: &#39;Book Antiqua&#39;, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;">My point is not to try to define exactly who is or is not an expat, but to call attention to the hierarchy of privilege that exists within the globally mobile community. From refugees, to migrant workers, to immigrants, to knowledge migrants, to expats: the difference lies in the ability of individuals to make choices over how and where they want to live. Often, the people we call expats are those who have the greatest control over their expatriation experience. &nbsp;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;Book Antiqua&#39;, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;">Regarding race, Lemieux expresses her concern that certain issues are overlooked because "much of what is written about expatriation is written by white women (like me)â€¦" and points to the example of how obtaining visas is easier for passport holders of European and North American countries. &nbsp;</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Acknowledging the TCK Experience</h3>
<p><em>[An exploratory opinion piece by Myra Dumapias. &nbsp;Opinions shared in this article do not necessarily reflect the opinions of TCKid as an organization, or its staff and volunteers.]</em></p>

<p>I love great conversation.&nbsp; I love stimulating intellectual discourse, and I love passionate debates that stay within the boundaries of mutual respect.&nbsp; However, there are some topics that are not up for debate.</p>
<p>If I had a conversation with colleagues about how I made my career decisions, most likely, they would not argue with me about it.&nbsp; If I spoke about my influential teachers and role models, they probably would not debate me in response. &nbsp;If I described the utmost significant relationships and events that impacted my life, people probably would not challenge me about it, and it would be unthinkable to minimize my expressions of reverence about family members who have passed away.</p>
<p>Most people would not scoff at matters close to another person's heart or stories out of someone's struggles, battle scars (literal or metaphorical) and victories. Yet, for some odd reason, there still seems to be a point that some people doubt, minimize or challenge: &nbsp;<a href="http://tckid.com/what-is-a-tck.html">the Third Culture Kid (TCK) identity and/or experience</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3><em><strong>&nbsp;It is as&nbsp;if&nbsp;the cause of what many TCK's experience as adults cannot be due to growing up as a global nomad or in a mobile family. &nbsp;The cause always has to be something elseâ€¦</strong></em></h3>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Throughout the years, I have heard the below responses that minimize the impact of a globally or culturally mobile childhood and adolescence, the first three of which I heard before I knew the term TCK:</p>
<p>"Yes, but I'm talking about real childhood struggles, like about money, gangs or drugs, not just emotions."</p>
<p>"Maybe you're affected this much about (best friend) leaving because you don't have brothers or sisters."</p>
<p>"But what does moving frequently have to do with romantic relationships?"</p>
<p>"You sure it's not because you're single?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I always wanted to travel and you're complaining because you travelled so much?"</p>
<p>"You're just being nostalgic."</p>
<p>"Isn't it just abandonment issues?"</p>
<p>"But I know some military brats and they didn't complain."</p>
<p>It is as&nbsp;if&nbsp;the cause of what many TCK's experience as adults cannot be due to growing up as a global nomad or in a mobile family. &nbsp;The cause always has to be something else: being overly nostalgic, sensitive, single, sheltered, abandoned, the list goes on. &nbsp;Some people cannot seem to accept that the frequent relocations or good-byes, the ever changing cross-cultural environments, the occasional separation from one or both parents, the constant pattern of leaving and making new friends, the sheer impact of multiple losses and other experiences can lead to the struggle to belong, the risk for depression (and in some cases, risk for suicide and PTSD), the existence of certain attachment issues, the itchy feet, or the sense of isolation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<h3><em><strong>&nbsp;â€¦If adult children of parents with career paths entirely different from each other, but share the commonality of global or cross cultural mobility, have found validation among one another in ways other identities or experiences do not, then it is not an imagined correlation</strong></em></h3>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, the effects are not only negative. &nbsp;There are also the gifts that are common, such as the tendency to be able to engage in dialogue or relate with just about anyone, global consciousness, innovative thinking, sharp observational skills, the ability to adapt to different environments, insight to cultural nuances, an ability to navigate language with advanced analytical and communication skills and other talents. &nbsp;However, the negative impact is something that is either underestimated or just dismissed.</p>
<p>It is true that global mobility or mobility through different cultures is not the only cause of these traits or experiences. Non-TCK's can also share certain traits with TCK's. &nbsp;However, if adult children of parents with career paths entirely different from each other but share the commonality of global or cross cultural mobility have found validation among one another in ways other identities or experiences do not, then it is not an imagined correlation. It should not be dismissed.</p>
<p>It is also true that in the grand scheme of everything within the scope societal problems, the struggles of TCK's do not have the same impact as the struggles of youth born into forced slavery or trafficking, for example, or major illnesses or extreme poverty. &nbsp;Still, for those who are affected, it can impact many things in life. &nbsp;This is why the persons who know the impact of certain experiences should be experts of these experiences, rather than someone who never experienced them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><em><strong>&nbsp;Some Words for My Readers:</strong></em></h3>
<p><strong>For my readers who may have thought or uttered statements similar to the above,</strong> I am not angry with you and do not hold anything against you.&nbsp; I only ask that you try to "listen" to the rest of what I have to share, letting me be the "teacher" for once. &nbsp;Questions from a place of curiosity are welcome, but please not from antagonism. &nbsp;I do not presume to know more than you about your life and the significance of your experiences. &nbsp;In return, I respectfully ask you to see how you cannot be the expert of my life experiences nor that of thousands of people who have benefitted from discovering they were not alone in our shared experiences.&nbsp; I ask this from you especially if you interact with TCK's or provide any services specifically geared towards TCK's (military brats, foreign-service brats, missionary kids, corporate dependents, and others who grew up globally mobile).</p>
<p><strong>For my readers for whom this may be new or more in-depth knowledge,</strong> I hope this will be somewhat informative for you. &nbsp;I appreciate your time in even reading this far and am grateful for any support for the TCK tribe. &nbsp;If, through your further discovery of other TCK topics, you find yourself relating to this identity, welcome to the tribe!</p>
<p><strong>For my readers who may fit the TCK definition,</strong> but do not necessarily relate to how global nomads have connected with one another around their TCK experiences, I am grateful to those who support us nonetheless. To those who were alongside us on our journey at some point but "got over it," I celebrate the diverse ways different people have moved on from the initial stages of discovering the TCK identity. Continuing to work in this field as it evolves is simply my way of "getting over it"</p>
<p><strong>Last but not least, for my readers who can relate to my experiences above,</strong> may the remainder of this article remind you that your voice is valuable and that you are not alone.&nbsp; <strong>To the early community leaders, artists, writers, researchers, speakers, educators and supporters out there,</strong> I would not even be here discussing this were it not for the hard work you have paved the trail with, which you blazed for us. &nbsp;I am deeply grateful for your sacrifices.</p>

<div class="main">
	<h4>&nbsp; While th<img class="alignleft wp-image-354" src="./News_files/04_World-Expat-Population_V5-490x1024.jpg" alt="FeedbacQ World Expat Population (Aug 2013)" width="288" height="601">is infographic, "World Expat Population: The Numbers" from FeedbacQ's blog (as of August 2013) may not provide definitions or clarity about the age ranges of the population studied, it does provide a way to visualize just how big the expat population may be. &nbsp;"Expats" as a term is also not synonymous with "Third Culture Kids" because, among other reasons, expats are not necessarily individuals who spent their developmental years with globally mobile lifestyles.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>&nbsp;Nevertheless, Here are some interesting numbers about the growing tribe of expats:</h4>
<h4></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>- In 1960, there were only 73 million expats. &nbsp;As of 2013, there are 230 million expats!</h4>
<h4>- Expats make up 3.1% of the global population.</h4>
<h4>- If all expats were to form a human chain, they would circle the earth one time. This is a distance of 40,000 km or almost 25,000 miles.</h4>
<h4>- About half, 49%, of expats are women.</h4>
<h4>- The top 5 countries that receive&nbsp;expat remittances are (starting from the country that receives the greatest amount): India, China, Mexico, Philippines, and Nigeria.</h4>
<h4>- &nbsp;The top 5 countries with the highest share of expats in their total population are: &nbsp;Qatar, the U.A.E., Kuwait, Jordan and Singapore.</h4>
<h4>- There are 6.32 million "American expats" (presumably from the USA) and 4.7 "Brits" abroad.</h4>
<h4>- One expat moves every 44 seconds.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>These numbers aren't far from another source's. &nbsp;According to the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/els/mig/World-Migration-in-Figures.pdf%C2%A0">Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)</a>, there are "232 million international migrants â€¦living in the world today."</h4>
<h4></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>In <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/pico_iyer_where_is_home?language=en">Pico Iyer's TedGlobal talk, "Where is Home" in June 2013,</a> he refers to a growing tribe of people "living in countries not their own" numbering 220 million. &nbsp;Iyer visualizes this number in the following way: "â€¦ if you took the whole population of Canada and the whole population of Australia and then the whole population of Australia again and the whole population of Canada again and doubled that number, you would still have fewer people than belong to this great floating tribe." &nbsp; Iyer also talks about "the number of us who live outside the old nation-state categories," a population that increased by "64 million just in the last 12 years, that soon there will be more of us than there are Americans."</h4>
<h4></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>These are astounding numbers indeed about a "floating tribe" who represent, in Iyer's terms, "the fifth-largest nation on Earth."</h4>

	<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>In memory of David C. Pollock</strong></h1>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong></strong><strong>A man ahead of his time</strong></h1>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong></strong><strong>June 9, 1939 - April 11, 2004</strong></h1>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong></strong><strong>Written by Ruth E. Van Reken</strong></h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">
</p><p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://news.tckid.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/David-C-Pollock.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-314" alt="David C Pollock" src="http://news.tckid.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/David-C-Pollock-193x300.jpg" width="193" height="300"></a>For many, many adult TCKs, our "aha!" moment when we realized we had a name came as we sat in Dave Pollock's lecture on <i>The TCK Profile</i> or read one of his early articles about this topic. Although Ruth Useem, sociologist from Michigan State University, coined the term Third Culture Kids in 1960, Dave was the person who translated it from an academic idea to making a difference in the lives of those who were living it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While living in Kenya near an international school in the 1970s, Dave heard many common themes from the students he interacted with from that school. In time Dave, a master synthesizer of distilling these recurring themes into easily accessible models, created his landmark <i>TCK Profile</i> and one of the first models of transition which he simply called <i>The Transition Experience. </i>&nbsp;When he&nbsp; returned to the States, Dave resumed leadership of an organization called Interaction, Inc. whose purpose was to help organizations sending families overseas to care for them well. He and Paul Nelson chaired the first international conference on matters related to TCKs in October, 1984 in Manila, Philippines.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Dave traveled endlessly to schools and organizations, including the UN, trying to create awareness of this growing phenomenon occurring in our globalizing world. Initially, he faced much skepticism both at the importance of dealing with issues of transition and identity development for global families, but also the question, "But it's not that big a deal because not that many families are involved." But Dave saw the big picture and where the world was headed. He persisted in not only raising awareness, but offering concrete strategies for how parents and organizations could help children grow strong in the context of a cross-cultural and highly mobile childhood.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">From the early 1980s, Dave set up reentry camps each summer to help repatriating TCKs learn how to successfully navigate these often rough waters so they wouldn't be caught in the unexpected rapids which sometimes swirled around. He saw early on that issues related to internationally mobile families was a global topic, not just a Western one. Dave worked diligently to help organizations from non-Western countries develop his signature "Flow of Care" for those they sent overseas and to think through the potential cultural changes their children might experience as they attended international schools rather than local schools. By the end of his life, Dave was also focusing his attention on refugee communities, understanding that in living outside of their original cultures these children faced many of the same challenges as traditional TCKs did.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When my friends and I had the idea of organizing the first Families in Global Transition (FIGT) conference in 1998, I called Dave to see if he would be willing to come and help us launch our dream. With less than eight weeks notice, he agreed and because he came, attendees came from many places to hear him and FIGT became reality. Dave was the plenary speaker for the first two conferences and did workshops for us regularly after that.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the end, Dave literally gave his life in and for the worldwide community he served so well. In 2004, although he did not feel well, Dave embarked on what was to be one more tour through Europe, Africa, and Asia. In one of his first stops in Vienna, he went from the stage at the American School to a local hospital where he was diagnosed with pancreatitis from a blocked bile duct. They performed surgery that night to remove the offending gallstone but the next morning he had a cardiac arrest and died 9 days later on Easter Sunday.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The loss of such a thought-leader in our community staggered me. How would we all go on when he was such a strong, passionate, and visible advocate? Soon after I received the news that his death was imminent, however, I attended a Good Friday service and pondered in the silent darkness the great "But why?" question. "Why Dave? Why now?" And then the verse came to mind from John 12:24, "Very truly I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds." I saw then that there were countless people all over the world in whose lives Dave had planted many seeds. Even though the one who had led and mentored so many of us was soon to be gone, all those seeds now scattered globally would take root and grow in new places. The topic had become too big for anyone person to carry alone. We all had to do our part.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And so it has been. FIGT is one of those trees that has grown from the seeds Dave Pollock planted in not only me, but in so many who have been instrumental in helping it grow. All who have ever attended or gained from this organization are in a real sense tasting the fruit from one of the trees he helped to plant in this world. It is right that on the tenth anniversary of his death, we stop and give thanks as we remember a truly great man who shared his pastoral heart with the world.&nbsp; Many of us will never be the same because of him. Thank you, David Pollock. I'm sorry you aren't here to see what so many seeds you planted have become. And thanks to you, Betty Lou, and your family for sharing him with us and today we recognize your personal loss of husband, father, and grandfather as well as our communal loss. I am grateful the FIGT Board established a David C. Pollock Scholarship Fund in his honor and memory so that his contributions remain fresh in our minds - as they should.</p>

<h2 align="center"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><b>by TCKid&nbsp;</b></span></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">[<span style="color: #0000ff;">The first year in review for the TCK &nbsp;and Cross Cultural Community</span>]</h3>
<p>Since the coining of the term "third culture kids" (TCK's), credited to&nbsp;<a href="http://sociology.msu.edu/uploads/documents/John_and_Ruth_Hill_Useem.pdf">Dr. Ruth Hill Useem&nbsp;"in the 1950s while&nbsp;a member of the Sociology Department at (Michigan State University),"</a>&nbsp;there have been many more developments in&nbsp;the study of, insights on, &nbsp;discussions on, &nbsp;and resources for &nbsp;TCK's. &nbsp;Throughout the decades, TCK's have created a distinct voice as a community. &nbsp;What was once a marginalized field of study or population identity has slowly been emerging out of the shadows with continued pioneering work. &nbsp;Early pioneers include researcher&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tckworld.com/useem/cottrell.html">Dr. Ann Baker Cottrell</a>&nbsp;who worked with Dr. Ruth Useem&nbsp;and Families in Global Transitions co-founder&nbsp;<a href="http://www.crossculturalkid.org/">Ruth Van Reken,</a>&nbsp;who in addition to other publications, co-authored&nbsp;<a href="http://www.crossculturalkid.org/">"Third Culture Kids: Growing Up Among Worlds"</a>&nbsp;with the late co-author&nbsp;<a href="http://www.interactionintl.org/whoisdavepollock.asp">David C. Pollock</a>. &nbsp;It was through Ruth and David's work that the definition of &nbsp;"third culture kid" began to have more consistency that the rest of the world began to widely use. &nbsp; The work of people like filmmaker&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bratsourjourneyhome.com/filmmakers.htm">Donna Musil</a>&nbsp;and her film&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bratsourjourneyhome.com/about.htm">BRATS</a>, which was featured on CNN, NPR and 178 countries worldwide on the Armed Forces Network Television have brought the TCK identity closer to mainstream attention.</p>
<p>With<a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2008/11/26/obamas-third-culture-team.html">&nbsp;TCK's described as the "prototype citizens of the future" in 1984 by Ted Ward</a>, then a sociologist at Michigan State University,&nbsp;it is worth noting not only how prominent TCK's such as US President Barack Obama, as referred to by Ruth Van Reken in a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2008/11/26/obamas-third-culture-team.html">2008 Daily Beast article</a>, have impacted the world, but also how the field of TCK studies and the community of organizations and service providers that cater to the TCK or expat community have evolved. &nbsp;As such, significant milestones have occurred with the passing of each year.</p>

She writes on<a href="http://www.ceciliahaynes.com/2013/09/guest-post-erin-tck.html#.UsMjYfRDsa2">&nbsp;Cecilia Haynes Sept 20 blog page, Unsettled TCK</a>, "It's a bizarre twist of the TCK life that the racism experienced overseas will never make you feel quite as lonely as not fitting in in your supposed home country. For me, growing up as a white TCK, no matter how long I dealt with the discrimination, I always held out hope for people to see me like I see myself - no race, no accent, no nationality."</p>

<p>(San Antonio) - TCKid: A Home for Third Culture Kids, a non-profit organization headquartered in San Antonio that serves those with an international upbringing or career, will launch its new interview series with Ruth Van Reken, co-author with the late Dave C. Pollock of international bestseller,&nbsp;<i>Third Culture Kid: Growing Up Among Worlds</i>&nbsp;on Saturday, Oct 26, 2013 at 10am Central. &nbsp;TCKid serves Third Culture Kid (TCK) adults and youth and the Cross Cultural population across geographical boundaries. TCKid's mission is to increase and support the individual and general awareness of the TCK experience and unique gifts by facilitating connection and community engagement. TCKid will broadcast the interview with this world-renowned author live on its community forum via&nbsp;<a href="http://tckid.com/">http://TCKid.com</a>&nbsp;with a Question and Answer session to allow for the audience to interact with the author.</p>
<p>"There tends to be many Third Culture Kids (TCK's) out there who don't even know they are a TCK. Most find out in their 30's or 40's and wish they would have known much earlier. I myself only found out about 3 years ago from a work colleague who identified me as such when I mentioned my cultural upbringing," says Myra Dumapias, TCKid Executive Director.&nbsp; Dumapias is a local resident of San Antonio who accepted the torch of leadership on a pro-bono basis in 2011 when TCKid's Founder Brice Royer was looking for someone who could continue the legacy he created for the community of TCK's.</p>
<p>"When I discovered I was a Third Culture Kid, went on TCKid.com and read this book by Ruth Van Reken and Dave C. Pollock, so much of what I've experienced since I left the expat community to fit in as another Asian-American â€¦.but never fully fit in in ways I could never place my finger onâ€¦all of a sudden found the missing piece of the puzzle," added Dumapias. Dumapias, who grew up as a daughter of a second generation foreign service diplomat, grew up in five countries, moved a dozen times and attended three high schools before graduating from high school.</p>
<p>Van Reken and Pollock, in T<i>hird Culture Kids: Growing Up Among Worlds</i>, define a TCK as "a person who spent a significant part of his or developmental years outside the parents' culture" who "frequently builds relationships to all of the cultures, while not having full ownership in any" (p 15&nbsp;<i>Third Culture Kids: Growing Up Among Worlds</i>, Nicholas Brealey Publishing: 2001.)</p>
<p>TCKid identifies four main family backgrounds their members come from: military, missionary, foreign service and multinational corporations.</p>
<p>Those who watched this year's&nbsp;<i>TedGlobal</i>&nbsp;talks may already be familiar with one experience of TCK's: that of the elusive process of defining home, as described by Pico Iyer in his talk "Where Is&nbsp; Home" (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3m6dV7Xo3Vc">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3m6dV7Xo3Vc</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.ted.com/2013/06/13/where-is-home-pico-iyer-at-tedglobal-2013/">http://blog.ted.com/2013/06/13/where-is-home-pico-iyer-at-tedglobal-2013/</a>). In his talk, Iyer mentions that people living in countries not their own now numbers close to 220 million and refers to the different possible answers to the question, "Where do you come from?"</p>
<p>For TCK's, explaining where you are from is only one part of the complex experience.</p>
<p>"Growing up with that much transition comes with it a great deal of loss that impacts your education and ways of relating to people, yet the fields of education, social work and mental health for a large part currently underestimate this impact because there is not enough understanding about it, and friends who did not grow up similarly don't fully understand either," says Dumapias, who has a Masters in Social Work and a background in non-profit management and human services, research and teaching.</p>
<p>"On the other hand, we are gifted in living in between worlds and are usually insightful about things people do overlook that we have so much to offer in marketing, community relations, philanthropy, management, education, mental health and other areas, beyond what is available in textbooks or classrooms."</p>
<p><i>Third Culture Kids: Growing Up Among Worlds</i>&nbsp;has this review by Wm Paul Young, author of the #1&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;Best Seller&nbsp;<i>The Shack</i>:</p>
<p>"As an adult TCK, I have long wrestled with how I fit into this world.&nbsp; This book is the 'bible' for anyone who wants to understand the blessings and curses of growing up multi-culturally."</p>
<p>Another review is by Scott Gration, Maj Gen, USAF (Ret), President Obama's Special Envoy to Sudan:</p>
<p>"Growing up as a TCK has been a gift and has significantly shaped my life and work.&nbsp; As I interact with world leaders one day and with those living in refugee camps the next, I continually draw upon my experience of living among different cultures.&nbsp; I am delighted to see the lessons learned from the traditional TCK experience live on in this new edition of&nbsp;<i>Third Culture Kids</i>."</p>
<p>TCKid wants to welcome everyone to join in the broadcast to capture those who may be working with a TCK, or are TCKs themselves, but do not yet know it.&nbsp; TCKid helps the community connect with one another and find a sense of belonging. TCKid will be providing a series of interviews that feature TCK's who have something educational to share, are in leadership positions, are artists, and have been involved in historical events. After the live broadcast on the 26<sup>th</sup>, a recording will remain on TCKid.com.</p>
<p>At this time, TCKid is open to working with corporate sponsors and partners who have a heart for this community interested in expanding its international network.&nbsp; TCKid is also in need of more volunteers interested in gaining experience in public relations, grant writing, marketing, social networking, community development, special events planning,&nbsp; fundraising, media and just having fun meeting diverse people around the world.&nbsp; Please contact visit http://tckid.com&nbsp;or email manager@tckid.com for more information on the interview series or organization.</p>

	<p class="comments"><a href="http://news.tckid.com/a-journey-to-home-an-interview-with-the-team-behind-where-is-home/#disqus_thread" data-disqus-identifier="269 http://news.tckid.com/?p=269">0 Comments</a></p>

<div class="main">
	<p>Where is home? Many TCKs are faced with this existential question on a regular basis, but not all are able to answer it with certainty. The idea of home is often challenged, reactions ranging from saying it is nowhere, everywhere, or even that it changes constantly. It is one of the themes of self-examination that run through many TCKs' experiences, an ongoing journey with multiple resolutions.</p>

	<p>In July 2011, TCKid hosted a mini festival of TCK-related short films in Toronto, featuring some of what would become popular films highlighting TCK experiences. One of these films was "Les Passagers", an emotional exploration of the identities and experiences of TCKs. Aga Alegria, the film's director and producer, shared her experiences live from Barcelona, Spain, and it has since become among the most-watched films about TCKs online.</p>
<p>Since then, Aga decided to expand on the stories shared in "Les Passagers", leading to the vision behind "Where is Home?", a documentary examining the experiences of TCKs and their search for "home." Aga and her production team â€” Producer Paul Saltzman, an Emmy Award-winning film and television producer and director, and Production Assistant, Alethea Wang, also a TCK â€” have high ambitions for "Where is Home?" and have since launched a fundraising campaign to support its goals of high quality editing and participation in major international film festivals. The campaign is ongoing on <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/Whereishome">Indiegogo</a> and ends on 7 March 2013.</p>
<p>TCKid took some time to talk to Aga and Alethea about "Where is Home?" and their campaign.</p>

Courtesy of Aga Alegria.</p></div>
<p><b>What was the inspiration behind "Where is Home?"?</b></p>
<p><b>Aga:</b> I've spent most of my life living out of a suitcase. &nbsp;I think I've moved a total of about 21 times so far! But I've always struggled with my inability to stay in one place. This struggle became really difficult when I hit 30. I longed desperately to be content with my decision to settle down in Toronto to start a family. But I could still feel the restlessness inside me and having to constantly fight the restlessness was very tough on me emotionally.</p>
<p>What was worse was that I felt alone in my struggle! No one around me, not even myself, could understand why I was so restless. So one night I just started 'Googling' how I felt, and that's how I came across the Third Culture Kid community. I finally felt understood! I had found my 'tribe' and I was inspired to tell our story. More than anything, I wanted to know how others like me coped with being uprooted, with feeling torn between many different cultures, and whether or not we were able to find 'HOME' while remaining in constant motion.</p>
<p><b>Can you give us a brief synopsis of what "Where is Home?" is about and what issues will be explored?</b></p>
<p><b>Alethea:</b> The film tells the stories of several adult Third Culture Kids while also following Aga's personal journey. To all of them, "Where is Home?" has been an extremely hard question to answer and each of them have embarked on an existential quest to find 'HOME'. The key issue that the film addresses is how to fashion a sense of 'HOME' or self when all the traditional coordinates are gone, and we aren't sure where our affiliations lie. How one comes to terms with the restlessness and ambivalence when those feelings are part and parcel of one's identity.</p>
<p>Another topic that we highlight is the positive qualities that arise due to moving between the wondrous diversity of cultures in our world. We'd like to share that with the world.</p>
<p><b>Talking about our experiences as TCKs can be both liberating and painful. How did it feel for you and the participants to work on the film?</b></p>
<p><b>Aga:</b> I learned A LOT from listening to the wisdom shared by the participants in my film! Everyone was excited to have a safe outlet to share his or her story. &nbsp;But to get to the emotional root of our experiences, I had to push them to truly open up their hearts and talk about feelings they had mostly kept to themselves before.</p>
<div id="attachment_271" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://news.tckid.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/photo-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-271 " alt="A still from &quot;Where is Home?&quot;  Courtesy of Aga Alegria." src="./News_files/photo-1-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A still from "Where is Home?" Courtesy of Aga Alegria.</p></div>
<p>Because the journey 'HOME' was such a struggle for all of us, having the opportunity to really speak out and share our experiences was extremely liberating! And for me, it allowed me to let go of the pain I felt inside and truly embrace the joys of having grown up as a Third Culture Kid. I think a lot of the participants would say the same.</p>
<p><b>It seems like a lot of people are making TCK-related films of different kinds, which is amazing! How will "Where is Home?" be different?</b></p>
<p><b>Alethea:</b> Yes! There are several shorts that have come out in the past two years â€”&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Gh_0Fx0B8">"Neither Here Nor There"</a> by Emma Yamazaki, <a href="http://vimeo.com/41264088">"So Where's Home?"</a> by Adrian Bautista, (both documentaries) and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMNhuTK3D2c">"The Road Home"</a> by our friend Rahul Gandotra (fictional, but based on personal experiences). All of these have been wonderful films that have highlighted Third Culture Kid identity.</p>
<p>On top of being the first feature length documentary, I think that the difference between our documentary and the others is that "Where is Home?" focuses in on exploring the concept of 'HOME' and how the search for home is necessarily different for those in constant movement.</p>
<p>I also feel that because Aga and most of the participants in the film have had a chance to live through the search for 'HOME', it has a different perspective then the other two documentaries. As a slightly younger TCK, I think this is really important to me because I want to have some foresight into what kind of obstacles, as well as rewards, might be in store for me as I continue to search for my own definition of 'HOME'.</p>
<p>Oh! And the film was shot in 5 different countries, so the viewer really does get a sense of movement and travel as they watch the film.</p>
<p><b>Back in 2011, TCKid hosted a global film screening event, streamed live from Toronto. One of those films was Aga's "Les Passagers". How does "Where is Home?" fit in or expand upon "Les Passagers"?</b></p>
<p><b>Aga:</b> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FouOIB_AAfw">"Les Passagers"</a> was made to map out the issues that Third Culture Kids face as a result of their mobile, cross-cultural upbringing - so like the other two shorts, it explores Third Culture Kid identity and gives the viewer a sense of what it's like to be a TCK.</p>
<p>Whereas "Where is Home?" - like Alethea mentioned - is really meant to create a dialogue and cause for reflection on what 'HOME' means in a globalized world. What does 'HOME' feel like? And why the journey 'HOME' is important.</p>
<p>We tried to make the message of "Where is Home?" a universal one.</p>

<p><b>You have now opened up the campaign for "Where is Home?" Please tell us a little bit about it and how we can support you.</b></p>
<p><b>Aga:</b> Making "Where is Home?" has taken me four years and I've invested my entire heart and soul into it because I saw how 'Les Passagers' has really helped Third Culture Kids put their experiences into perspective, allowing us to connect with one another and feel understood. Our goal with "Where is Home?" is to expand on that connection to include people who are not necessarily Third Culture Kids but who also feel 'lost' in our increasingly complex global society. This film has been almost exclusively funded out of my own pocket so far, so I really do need the financial support to finish the post-production editing.</p>
<p><b>Alethea:</b> Right, we've launched a crowd-funding campaign on <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/Whereishome">Indiegogo</a>, where you can make a donation to help with post-production of our film. It's more like an investment really, because your donation comes with a perk, such as getting a copy of the DVD once it's released!</p>
<p>We also love hearing from all the TCKs out there so please connect with us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/whereishomethefilm">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/whereishomefilm">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://whereishomethefilm.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>, and <a href="http://www.whereishomethefilm.com/">WordPress</a>.&nbsp; Also, because our goal is to eventually submit the film to film festivals, any sort of publicity is great. So, if you know of any organizations who might be interested in "Where is Home?", please let us know!</p>

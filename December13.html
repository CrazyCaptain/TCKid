			<h4>[The first year in review for the TCK  and Cross Cultural Community]</h4>
			<br>
			
			<!-- -->
			
			<p>Since the coining of the term "third culture kids" (TCK's), credited to 
			<a href="http://sociology.msu.edu/uploads/documents/John_and_Ruth_Hill_Useem.pdf" target='_blank'>Dr. Ruth Hill Useem "in the 1950s while a 
			member of the Sociology Department at (Michigan State University),"</a> there have been many more developments in the study of, insights on,  
			discussions on,  and resources for  TCK's.  Throughout the decades, TCK's have created a distinct voice as a community.  What was once a 
			marginalized field of study or population identity has slowly been emerging out of the shadows with continued pioneering work.  Early pioneers 
			include researcher <a href="http://www.tckworld.com/useem/cottrell.html" target='_blank'>Dr. Ann Baker Cottrell</a> who worked with Dr. Ruth 
			Useem and Families in Global Transitions co-founder <a href="http://www.crossculturalkid.org/" target='_blank'>Ruth Van Reken,</a> who in addition 
			to other publications, co-authored <a href="http://www.crossculturalkid.org/" target='_blank'>"Third Culture Kids: Growing Up Among Worlds"</a> 
			with the late co-author <a href="http://www.interactionintl.org/whoisdavepollock.asp" target='_blank'>David C. Pollock</a>.  It was through Ruth 
			and David's work that the definition of  "third culture kid" began to have more consistency that the rest of the world began to widely use. 
			The work of people like filmmaker <a href="http://www.bratsourjourneyhome.com/filmmakers.htm" target='_blank'>Donna Musil</a> and her film 
			<a href="http://www.bratsourjourneyhome.com/about.htm" target='_blank'>BRATS</a>, which was featured on CNN, NPR and 178 countries worldwide on 
			the Armed Forces Network Television have brought the TCK identity closer to mainstream attention.</p>

			<br>
			
			<p>With<a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2008/11/26/obamas-third-culture-team.html" target='_blank'> TCK's described as the "prototype citizens of 
			the future" in 1984 by Ted Ward</a>, then a sociologist at Michigan State University, it is worth noting not only how prominent TCK's such as US 
			President Barack Obama, as referred to by Ruth Van Reken in a 
			<a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2008/11/26/obamas-third-culture-team.html" target='_blank'>2008 Daily Beast article</a>, have 
			impacted the world, but also how the field of TCK studies and the community of organizations and service providers that cater to the TCK or expat 
			community have evolved.  As such, significant milestones have occurred with the passing of each year.</p>


			<br><br>

			<h4>TCKid reviews some significant milestones for the cross cultural, TCK, or expat community from 2013.  Here are some of them:</h4>

			<br>
			
			<p><b>TCK JT McInnis, </b>while watching a film at a cinema, makes a connection between his teen years and the film he was watching, 
			<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1024648/awards" target='_blank'><i>Argo</i>, which won multiple awards</a>.  JT McInnis realizes there was a 
			part of the story the world did not know and writes about <a href="http://3dculturekid.blogspot.co.nz/2012/11/argo-canadian-caper-and-story-of-young.html" target='_blank'>
			his involvement with the hostage situation in Tehran 1979 in his blog</a>.  A central Texas television network 
			<a href="http://www.kvue.com/story/news/2014/05/22/2365824/" target='_blank'>journalist takes the opportunity to interview him </a>in February.</p>

			<br>
			<p><b>Families in Global Transition (FIGT)</b> introduces "IGNITE Sessions" in its annual conference program and in March of 2013, 
			<a href="http://www.figt.org/" target='_blank'>FIGT </a> offers seven engaging IGNITE Sessions.  With the concept, "enlighten us but make it quick," 
			the six-minute-forty-second maximum sessions are designed to generate awareness and stimulate discussion.  Check out the

			Redefined</a>!</p>

			<br>
			<p><b>Aga Alegria</b> decides to expand on the stories shared in her short film, "Les Passagers" which led to the vision behind "<i>Where is Home?,
			</i>" a documentary examining the experiences of TCKs and their search for "home."  Aga and her production team â€” Producer Paul Saltzman, an Emmy 
			Award-winning film and television producer and director, and Production Assistant, Alethea Wang, also a TCK - start a successful campaign that 
			ended in March 2013 to gain support for "<i>Where is Home?</i>"   Their campaign was featured in a TCKid
			<a href="March13.html" target='_blank'>interview with TCKid Executive 
			Assistant Erin Sinogba </a>.  The "<i>Where is Home?</i>" campaign and Aga's work was also referred to by the International New York Times in "
			<a href="http://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/28/where-is-home-for-a-third-culture-kid/?_r=0" target='_blank'>Where is Home for a Third 
			Culture Kid?"</a></p>

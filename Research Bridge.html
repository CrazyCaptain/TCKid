			<h3 class="Maroon"> Linking Globally Cross-Cultural Researchers and the Public</h3>
			<p class="blog-post-meta">Was launched at April 2014</a></p>

			<p>TCKid, a non-profit organization that serves the community of third culture kid adults and youth and those who serve this community, 
			is sponsoring the first beneficiary of its TCKid Research Bridge Sponsorship program.</p>
			
			<br>
			<h4>This new program aims to:</h4>
			
			<p class="Maroon">1) cultivate the relationships between globally cross-cultural researchers and the public,</span></p>
			<p class="Maroon">2) facilitate the increase of data, statistics and information about the TCK, Cross Cultural Kid (CCK), global nomad and expat population, and</span></p>
			<p class="Maroon">3) foster the public's access to research and information about these populations.</span></p>

			<br>
			<p>We at TCKid believe that cultivating the relationships between researchers and the general public will equip researchers with information and the tools they need to complete studies successfully, as well enable researchers to be invested in the importance of relaying information back to those that helped make the research possible.  This two-way relationship will help increase the amount of research on the TCK, CCK, global nomad and expat population, and TCKid will help make that information as accessible as possible to the public.</p>
			
			<p>The TCKid Research Bridge Sponsorship program will select and sponsor up to four (or more as resources become available) principal investigators' 
			cross cultural studies each year through an application process.  TCKid will provide each principal investigator selected to be a beneficiary: an 
			individual website linked to TCKid's main webpages and social networking platform dedicated to the study, assistance in recruiting study participants 
			among TCKid's membership as appropriate to each study's methodology, inclusion in TCKid Talks interview series to be broadcast on TCKid TV.</p>
			
			<p>The first beneficiary is Katia Mace, a CCK who grew up between Russia, England, South Africa and Spain and is currently working towards a PhD 
			in Psychology and Education at the University of Cambridge.  She is conducting a study on cultural identity and belonging amongst TCKs/CCKs.  Mace 
			holds an MPhil in Psychology and Education from Cambridge and a BSc in Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method from the London School of Economics. 
			You may find out more about Mace's study through TCKid's Research Bridge.</p>

			<br>
			<h4>TCK/ CCK/ Global Nomad/ Expat Community Research all on one page...</h4>
			
			<p>TCKid will also offer a section that will make various types of completed research studies on the TCK, CCK, global nomad and expat community 
			available and accessible to the general community.</p>
			
			<p>The research that will be available include academic, non-academic, formal, informal, peer reviewed and those that are not peer-reviewed. 
			Please support this initiative!! Our ultimate outcome is to help increase the data, statistics and information about the TCK, CCK, global nomad 
			and expat population.  Studies on populations identified by other terms, ie. Migrant families may also be included.</p>
			
			<p>If you have any questions about this program or would like to apply, please contact tckidresearchbridge@tckid.com. (Application form will 
			be made available soon)</p>

			<!-- How do we operate and sustain these programs? -->			
			<h4>We need your help to continue and grow this program!</h4>

			<p>TCKid is a non-profit, 501(c)(3) organization is run strictly by part-time volunteers.  TCKid's Chief Executive Officer, in charge of the 
			overall operations of TCKid, provides professional nonprofit management services gained from over a decade of work, development and management 
			roles the non-profit sector  on a part-time pro-bono basis.  TCKidâ€™s Chief Executive Assistant is also a part-time volunteer. Both have sustained 
			TCKid with a small budget for operations, but TCKid needs to grow.  This Research Bridge program cannot grow without your support.</p>
			
			<p>Having received its 501(c)(3) public charity status only in November of 2013, TCKid will now be able to apply for funding and corporate 
			sponsorship.  However, public charities require both grants and the support of individual donors and philanthropists.</p>
			
			<p>TCKid can accomplish much more with regular volunteer and donation support from individuals dedicated to the cross-cultural population and 
			businesses interested in corporate sponsorship.</p>
			
			<p class="Maroon">Please consider becoming a regular donor of TCKid to ensure these programs are sustained and the newly developing programs come into fruition.</p>
			
			<p class="Maroon">All gifts and donations to TCKid, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit public charity, may be considered tax-deductible. Please visit our 
			<a href="Support.html">Why Support Us page for details on donations from other countries.</a></p>

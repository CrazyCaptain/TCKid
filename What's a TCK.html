					</h4>

				<div id="collapseTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse">
					<div class="panel-body">
						<p>Sociologist Ruth Hill Useem coined the term "Third Culture Kids" after spending a year on two separate occasions in India with her 
						three children, in the early fifties. Initially they used the term "third culture" to refer to the process of learning how to relate 
						to another culture; in time they started to refer to children who accompany their parents into a different culture as "Third Culture 
						Kids." Useem used the term "Third Culture Kids" because TCKs integrate aspects of their birth culture (the first culture) and the new 
						culture (the second culture), creating a unique "third culture"</p>

						<center><h4>Military/ARMY BRATS</h4></center>
						<p style="padding-left:20px;padding-right:20px;" align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Military brats, primarily from the United States, are the most mobile of TCKs but generally spend only a few years abroad, and 
						sometimes none at all. Approximately 41% of military brats spend less than 5 years in foreign countries. They are the least likely 
						TCKs to develop connections with the locals. Because military bases aim for self-sufficiency, military brats tend to be exposed the 
						least to the local culture. Also, because of the self-sufficiency of military bases and the distinctiveness of military culture, even 
						those military brats who never lived abroad can be isolated to some degree from the civilian culture of their "home" country.</p>

						<p style="padding-left:20px;padding-right:20px;" align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						While parents of military brats had the lowest level of education of the five categories, approximately 36% of USA military brat TCK families have at least one parent with an advanced degree. This is significantly higher than the general population.
						</p>
							
						<br>		
			<h4 style="padding-left:20px;">Non-military government</h4>
			<p style="padding-left:20px;padding-right:20px;" align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Nonmilitary government TCKs are the most likely to have extended experiences in foreign countries for extended periods. 44% have lived in at least four countries. 44% will also have spent at least 10 years outside of their passport country. Their involvement with locals and others from their passport country depends on the role of the parent. Some may grow up moving from country to country in the diplomatic corps  while others may live their lives near military bases.
			</p>
			
			<br>		
			<h4 style="padding-left:20px;">Religious / Missionary Kids</h4>
			<p style="padding-left:20px;padding-right:20px;" align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Missionary Kids (MKs) typically spend the most time overseas in one country. 85% of MKs spend more than 10 years in foreign countries and 72% lived in only one foreign country. MKs generally have the most interaction with the local populace and the least interaction with people from their passport country. They are the most likely to integrate themselves into the local culture. 83% of missionary kids have at least one parent with an advanced degree.
			</p>

			<br>		
			<h4 style="padding-left:20px;">Business kids</h4>
				<p style="padding-left:20px;padding-right:20px;" align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Business families also spend a great deal of time in foreign countries. 63% of business TCK's have lived in foreign countries at least 10 years but are more likely than MKs to live in multiple countries. Business TCKs will have a fairly high interaction with their host nationals and with others from their passport country.
				</p>
						
				<br>		
				<h4 style="padding-left:20px;">Other</h4>
				<p style="padding-left:20px;padding-right:20px;" align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					The "Other" category includes anybody who does not fit one the above descriptions. They include: intergovernmental agencies, educators, international non-governmental organizations, media, etc. This group typically has spent the least amount of time in foreign countries (42% are abroad for 1-2 years and 70% for less than 5.) Again their involvement with local people and culture can vary greatly.  The parents of "Others" are the most likely of TCKs to have parents with an advanced degree (89% of families have an advanced degree.)

					</h4>
				</div>
            
				<div id="collapseFour" class="panel-collapse collapse">
				   <div class="panel-body">
					<p>There are different characteristics that impact the typical Third Culture Kid:</p>
						
					<ul>
					<li>TCKs are 4 times as likely as non-TCKs to earn a bachelor's degree (81% vs 21%)</li>
					<li>40% earn an advanced degree (as compared to 5% of the non-TCK population.)</li>
					<li>45% of TCKs attended 3 universities before earning a degree.</li>
					<li>44% earned undergraduate degree after the age of 22.</li>
					<li>Educators, medicine, professional positions, and self employment are the most common professions for TCKs.</li>
					<li>TCKs are unlikely to work for big business, government, or follow their parents' career choices. "One won't find many TCKs in large corporations. Nor are there many in government ... they have not followed in parental footsteps".</li>
					<li>90% feel "out of sync" with their peers.</li>
					<li>90% report feeling as if they understand other cultures/peoples better than the average American.</li>
					<li>80% believe they can get along with anybody.</li>
					<li>Divorce rates among TCKs are lower than the general population, but they marry older (25+).</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Military brats, however, tend to marry earlier.</li>
					</ul>		
					<li>Linguistically adept (not as true for military ATCKs.)</li>
						<ul>
						<li>A study whose subjects were all "career military brats" those who had a parent in the military from birth through high school shows that brats are linguistically adept.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Teenage TCKs are more mature than non-TCKs, but ironically take longer to "grow up" in their 20s.</li>
					<li>More welcoming of others into their community.</li>
					<li>Lack a sense of "where home is" but often nationalistic.</li>
					<li>Depression and suicide are more prominent among TCK's.
					<li>Some studies show a desire to "settle down" others a "restlessness to move".</li>
					</ul>

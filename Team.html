			<br>Hi TJ,

I would like to check my updated accomplishment before I consult all my concerns to TCKid Team.

			<!-- Team 2007-2008-->
			
			<h3 class="Maroon">Forum Moderators & Officers of TCKID 2007-2008</h3>

			<p><strong>Ayako Nakamura</strong><br>
			Forum Administrator</p>
			
			<br>
			<p>A forum moderator is someone granted special powers to enforce the rules of an Internet forum, enforces the guidelines where necessary, helps new members feel welcome, and answer forum-related questions.</p>

			<br>
			
			<p>Ayako has a B.A. in sociology from the International Christian University and has used her background in sociology and bilingual/multicultural skills in various fields including television and commercial productions, global advertising agencies such as Grey Advertising, Bates and Dentsu Wunderman Cato Johnson. After a brief stint with a HeadlightVision, a brand consultancy in London, she retired to her dream home in Costa del Sol and lives there.</p>

			<br>

			<br>
			
			<p><strong>Daniel Nguyen-Phuoc</strong><br>
			Forum Moderator/Co-Founder of Blog/Columnist of Ask Uncle<br>
			How to describe Dan? A thinker, a political writer, a great cook, with a great taste in house music. A European TCK at heart who loves meeting new people, Dan embodies the true meaning of what it means to live a well-rounded and balanced life: Work hard and play hard. When I first approached Dan in October 2007, I noticed his talent in writing and proposed to hire him as a writer for a small TCK writing/website book project, which eventually evolved into a  contest and became the first version of the TCKID blog. Dan volunteered and became an editor of the blog, and contributed with his column called: "Ask Uncle!" from 2007-2008. He is currently a political columnist and writer at the Examiner.   http://examiner.com</p>

			<br>
			
			<p><strong>Laura Ahlgren</strong><br>
			Editor &amp; Moderator<br>

			<br>
			Laura is currently in university in the US, studying Life Sciences Communication with a concentration in Marketing (read: Science Marketing). She also has a background teaching languages to children through the Concordia Language Villages programs as well as individual ESL teaching in China, where she just spent a semester studying Chinese.</p>

			<br>
			<p>As for her "where she's from" answer: She was born in Finland, moved to Germany when she was 1 year old, then moved to the US when she was 2 years old and has been there ever since. However, she has spent nearly every summer of her childhood in Finland, including a year there in high school on an "exchange."</p>

			<br>
			<p><strong>Moderators/Officers</strong></p>

			<p>A forum moderator is someone granted special powers to enforce the rules of an Internet forum, enforces the guidelines where necessary, helps new members feel welcome, and answer forum-related questions.</p>

			
			<br>
			<p><strong>Cynthia Yang</strong></p>

			<p>Cynthia, or affectionately known as “Panda”, loves to befriend TCKs especially if it includes eating exotic food together while listening to Jazz music! An engineer by trade, putting the 'g' into diligent and 'f' into friend, she was so technically detailed, that it made us clean our code and sharpen our act. She has a big heart for people who are different, and wants to offer them a place where they can be themselves and have friends they can actually connect with.  She joined as a moderator in 2008, helped new members feel welcomed, ran the Postcard Project and translated the TCK definition in Mandarin.  Cynthia is now connecting with TCKs in CT, U.S and working towards getting an MBA to continue making a difference in the world.</p>

			
			<br>
			<p><strong>Kristine Vasquez</strong><br>

			Kristine was the youngest one in the community and worked hard to help TCK teens. She was also was a regular blogger, a talented photographer, making a point to highlight points of multicultural interest, and the funny things that Canadians do.</p>

			<!-- Research Bridge -->
			
			<br>
			<h4><strong>TCKid Research Bridge</strong></h4>

			<p>We support the research projects of our members because much more information and data is needed about our community. We offer to up to four&nbsp;(or more as resources become available)&nbsp;researchers who conduct academic or not-for-profit research on the Third Culture Kid (TCK), Cross Culture Kid (CCK), global nomad and expat populations dedicated space on our social networking platform (on TCKid.com). Our goal is to facilitate community engagement in research projects and help build relationships between researchers and our community members.</p>

			<p>We believe creating these relationships will better equip and inform researchers and enable researchers to be invested in the importance of relaying information back to those that helped make the research possible, as well as encourage the community's investment in research projects. TCKid will also offer a section that will make various types of completed research studies on the TCK, CCK, global nomad and expat community available and accessible to the general community.</p>

			<p>The research that will be available include academic, non-academic, formal, informal, peer reviewed and those that are not peer-reviewed.&nbsp; Please Our ultimate outcome is to help increase the data, statistics and information about the TCK, CCK, global nomad and expat population.&nbsp; Studies on populations identified by other terms, ie. Migrant families may also be included.</p>

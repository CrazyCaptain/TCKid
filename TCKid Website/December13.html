			<h4>[The first year in review for the TCK  and Cross Cultural Community]</h4>
			<br>
			
			<!-- -->
			
			<p>Since the coining of the term "third culture kids" (TCK's), credited to&nbsp;<a href="http://sociology.msu.edu/uploads/documents/John_and_Ruth_Hill_Useem.pdf">Dr. Ruth Hill Useem&nbsp;"in the 1950s while&nbsp;a member of the Sociology Department at (Michigan State University),"</a>&nbsp;there have been many more developments in&nbsp;the study of, insights on, &nbsp;discussions on, &nbsp;and resources for &nbsp;TCK's. &nbsp;Throughout the decades, TCK's have created a distinct voice as a community. &nbsp;What was once a marginalized field of study or population identity has slowly been emerging out of the shadows with continued pioneering work. &nbsp;Early pioneers include researcher&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tckworld.com/useem/cottrell.html">Dr. Ann Baker Cottrell</a>&nbsp;who worked with Dr. Ruth Useem&nbsp;and Families in Global Transitions co-founder&nbsp;<a href="http://www.crossculturalkid.org/">Ruth Van Reken,</a>&nbsp;who in addition to other publications, co-authored&nbsp;<a href="http://www.crossculturalkid.org/">"Third Culture Kids: Growing Up Among Worlds"</a>&nbsp;with the late co-author&nbsp;<a href="http://www.interactionintl.org/whoisdavepollock.asp">David C. Pollock</a>. &nbsp;It was through Ruth and David's work that the definition of &nbsp;"third culture kid" began to have more consistency that the rest of the world began to widely use. &nbsp; The work of people like filmmaker&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bratsourjourneyhome.com/filmmakers.htm">Donna Musil</a>&nbsp;and her film&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bratsourjourneyhome.com/about.htm">BRATS</a>, which was featured on CNN, NPR and 178 countries worldwide on the Armed Forces Network Television have brought the TCK identity closer to mainstream attention.</p>

			<br>
			
			<p>With<a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2008/11/26/obamas-third-culture-team.html">&nbsp;TCK's described as the "prototype citizens of the future" in 1984 by Ted Ward</a>, then a sociologist at Michigan State University,&nbsp;it is worth noting not only how prominent TCK's such as US President Barack Obama, as referred to by Ruth Van Reken in a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2008/11/26/obamas-third-culture-team.html">2008 Daily Beast article</a>, have impacted the world, but also how the field of TCK studies and the community of organizations and service providers that cater to the TCK or expat community have evolved. &nbsp;As such, significant milestones have occurred with the passing of each year.</p>


			<br><br>

			<h4>TCKid reviews some significant milestones for the cross cultural, TCK, or expat community from 2013. &nbsp;Here are some of them:</h4>

For me, growing up as a white TCK, no matter how long I dealt with the discrimination, I always held out hope for people to see me like I see myself - no race, no accent, no nationality."</p>

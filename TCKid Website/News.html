			<h3 class="Maroon">The TCK/ Cross Culture Community 2014 Year-In-Review By TCKid</h3>
			</center>
            
			<br>
			<p>In the process of researching and pulling together information for this year in review, I discovered that our voices within the <a href="http://tckid.com/what-is-a-tck.html">Third Culture Kid</a> (TCK) or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/cross-cultural-kids-everywhere/norma-mccaig-has-passed-away/50153600618">global nomad</a> and cross culture community have added more color to the canvas of our identity. &nbsp;The diversity of backgrounds, opinions, concerns, and experiences within the tribe have begun to become more visible or vocal. &nbsp;We have begun to move beyond the standard scripts about matters that continue to be close to our hearts: We have moved into discussing social concerns and human experiences and brought them back into the fold of how we experience them as TCKs or cross cultural individuals. &nbsp;</p>
			<br>
			<p>We have demonstrated that global mobility and cross cultural navigation will always influence how we experience life on some level. &nbsp;However, we also fear, cry about and are vulnerable to, as well as celebrate, enjoy and rejoice at, the same things as individuals who grew up in one town. &nbsp; We bleed, hurt, can be flawed and are mortal as any other human beings. &nbsp;We just have the unshakable context of cultural or geographic mobility. &nbsp;We find our strengths to overcome challenges through the mobility that made us who we are and when we get up to stand, speak out or do something, we change things around us.</p>
			<br>
			<p>We speak, write and create out of being in between worlds, but we also share some experiences with the rest of the world. &nbsp;We navigate community, academia, human services, and private enterprise out of being from nowhere and everywhere, but we have also established a niche securely anchored to our tribe's deep roots and history. &nbsp;</p>
			<br>
			<p>I hope you enjoy reading through these highlights of first times, milestones and significant events from 2014, which continue the history of our tribe. &nbsp;If a story or event was not mentioned or overlooked, it definitely does not reflect its significance for the tribe. &nbsp;I wish to thank all who took the time to contribute their stories and Erin Sinogba for her assistance. &nbsp;Many of the stories, discovered in the research for this article, were very eye-opening for me and I hope you will find them valuable as well. &nbsp;</p>
			<br>
			<p>Thank you all for being you and making our tribe look simply human, beautiful, powerful.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>In January, Actress and writer&nbsp;<a href="http://cargocollective.com/ElizabethLiangSoloShowandWriter/About-Elizabeth-Liang">&nbsp;<strong>Elizabeth Liang</strong></a><strong>'s show, <em><a href="http://cargocollective.com/aliencitizen">Alien Citizen: an earth odyssey</a></em></strong>, a play about being "from everywhere and nowhere," starts to make its rounds at colleges, starting with California State University - Los Angeles, followed by Princeton and M.I.T. in February and Wesleyan, Williams and other colleges the rest of the year. &nbsp;Liang also starts touring internationally in Iceland and Panama and keynotes for <a href="http://www.figt.org/2014_keynotes#ClosingKeynote">Families in Global Transition</a>&nbsp;(FIGT)&nbsp;in March. &nbsp;Aside from the global nomad identity, <a href="http://www.hapahappyhour.libsyn.com/">Liang also addresses mixed race topics </a>in the show, which she performs at the&nbsp;Critical Mixed Race Studies conference at DePaul University in Chicago in November. &nbsp;According to Liang,</p>
			
				<blockquote>
				Something about the learned role of the outsider seems to strike a chord, even in people who I would not expect to relate to that. &nbsp;This has been a joyous and humbling discovery and a reminder of lessons I learned while growing up as a TCK: we all have more in common than we know. &nbsp;My dream is to take the show to festivals and international schools worldwide.

			<p>In February, <a href="http://thejakartaglobe.beritasatu.com/news/yogyakarta-beset-by-ash-awaits-cleansing-rains/" target="_blank"><strong>Jakarta Globe</strong> reports on the effects of the thick ash that covered Yogyakarta after Mt Elud's eruption </a>in east Java and<strong> features the photo of Ardi Kuhn</strong>, a TCK who was once one of TCKid's local group leaders. &nbsp;Kuhn is a <a href="http://kakiseni.com/events/seronok/">sound and visual artist</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AE1aDAqnwao">web developer and works as a teacher</a> in Java.</p>
			<br>
			
			<p><strong><a href="http://www.babble.com/home/">Babble</a>,</strong> a Disney sponsored family-centered online lifestyle magazine, publishes an article written by TCK <strong>Rachel Pieh Jones</strong> in February on, &nbsp;<a href="http://www.babble.com/babble-voices/sexual-harassment-and-third-culture-kids/">The Conversation We're Not Having<strong>: Sexual Harassment and Third Culture Kids</strong>&nbsp;</a>. &nbsp; In the article, <a href="http://www.djiboutijones.com/about/">Jones</a> confronts how expat adults and teens experience sexual harassment and discusses the importance of taking about the problem. &nbsp;Jones points out, "While sexual harassment is <i>always</i> awful, shaming, and wrong, experiencing it as a foreigner carries the added dimension of isolation and uncertainty and experiencing it as a foreign <em>kid</em> is especially traumatic." &nbsp;</p>
				
				<blockquote><p>Jones herself has experienced sexual harassment herself as an expat. &nbsp;In her <a href="http://www.djiboutijones.com/2013/09/the-story-women-need-to-tell/">September 2013 Djibouti Jones blog article</a>, Jones states, &nbsp;I listen to the stories of the women around me. And I say, <i>me too. That happened to me too.</i> I tell my story, I don't hide it because it is embarrassing, because my reaction wasn't what I wish it were. I hear the women around me say, <i>me too.</i> And say, <i>I'm sorry.</i> And say, <i>I'm angry with you, for you.</i> I believe we are the walking wounded. Yes, we are wounded, but yes, we are walking forward, out the front door.</p></blockquote>
				
			<p>Jones' TCK and expat related work also appears in other publications, such as <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/thisisourcity/7thcity/you-cant-consume-your-way-to-social-justice.html#comments">Christianity Today</a>, and the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/fashion/a-gift-from-allah-modern-love.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0">New York Times</a>. &nbsp;</p>

			<p><strong>Heidi Tunberg</strong>, a TCK who works with TCKs and loves collecting resources and information about the Third Culture experience starts creating <strong><a href="http://www.pinterest.com/heidinindi/">TCK-themed boards on Pinterest</a></strong> around February. &nbsp;"I discovered Pinterest was a perfect place to organize my collections to make them accessible to others.... I created 17 TCK-themed boards spotlighting books by and for TCKs, TCK-themed movies and videos, articles &amp; blog posts, famous TCKs, fun items, quotes and memes for TCKs, and more." &nbsp;Tunberg welcomes suggestions for any material to add to her TCK-themed Pinterest boards. &nbsp;

			<p>In April, <strong>news about a suspected child molester shakes the community of TCK's and expats</strong>. &nbsp;TCKs in social media rapidly share a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-seeking-public-assistance-in-the-investigation-of-an-international-teacher-suspected-of-molesting-children-abroad">press release issued by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)&nbsp;</a>asking the public for assistance in finding more information about the suspected "international child predator," who worked as international school teacher who worked in nine different countries, including "Nicaragua, the United Kingdom, Venezuela, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Greece, Iran, Spain, and Lebanon." &nbsp;According to the&nbsp;FBI, which worked with the "Department of State-Diplomatic Security Service and other national and international law enforcement partners" on the investigation, William James Vahey "used sleeping pills to drug his victims, but investigators (wanted) to learn more about his methods and what drugs he may have used."</p>
			<br>
			<p>In separate incidents involving the Jakarta International School, outsourced school employees are arrested in April after investigations about multiple cases of reported incidents of <a href="http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/04/15/six-year-old-allegedly-abused-int-l-school.html">repeated gang rape of a kindergarten student</a>. &nbsp;After the initial investigation, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/jakarta-international-school-teachers-and-staff-at-top-international-school-accused-of-raping-students-as-young-as-five-9819626.html">other families begin to report incidents that happened to their own children</a> allegedly involving faculty and administration. &nbsp;Two faculty members on trial, including one Canadian citizen, claim innocence, along with supportive family members and fellow faculty, and <a href="http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/canada/canadian-detained-in-indonesia-to-have-first-day-in-court-tuesday-family-284398231.html">criticize the justice system of Indonesia as being corrupt</a>.</p>

			<p>In July, <strong>Myra Dumapias</strong> launches <strong><a href="http://thelastboardingcall.com/">The Last Boarding Call</a>,&nbsp;</strong>a resource for TCKs and global nomads on the journeys of aging, retirement, sudden disability or death and dying. &nbsp; Dumapias was a 2014 FIGT scholar who first observed the impact of her comments about this topic at the 2014 FIGT conference. &nbsp;Her blog addresses how certain expats and global nomads, due to economic disparities among expats' passport countries, are affected by the above life stages. &nbsp;Dumapias illustrates in <a href="http://thelastboardingcall.com/expat-aging-caregiving-disability-retirement/">Expat Aging, Caregiving and Related Journeys: Why Bring Them Up</a>, &nbsp;</p>
				
				<blockquote><p>
				It is an uncomfortable topic, but a high ranking diplomat, for example, can experience a sudden plummet in his or her socio-economic status if faced with a sudden health crisis around the time of retirement...No matter how much one saves or plans financially, a perfect storm of unexpected events may quickly wipe it all away because a crisis can be just the beginning of a tough road.&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the whole family and potentially three generations can become drastically impacted...&nbsp;
				</p></blockquote>
				
			<p>With a background in and as an&nbsp;educator in the social work profession, and a <a href="http://thelastboardingcall.com/honoring-sandwich-generation-expats-third-culture-kids-1-of-2/">TCK who spent spent years as a sandwich-generation caregiver </a>of a disabled parent, Dumapias hopes to&nbsp;"help other families prepare and make the most of their time together in this journey where there is no turning back." &nbsp;</p>

			<p><a href="http://diane-lemieux.com/mobilelife/?p=1133"><strong>Diane Lemieux</strong> </a>discusses class and white privilege in <strong><a href="http://diane-lemieux.com/mobilelife/?p=1133">The Blindness of Expat Privilege</a>&nbsp;</strong>in October. &nbsp;Lemieux states, &nbsp;</p>
				
				<blockquote>My point is not to try to define exactly who is or is not an expat, but to call attention to the hierarchy of privilege that exists within the globally mobile community. From refugees, to migrant workers, to immigrants, to knowledge migrants, to expats: the difference lies in the ability of individuals to make choices over how and where they want to live. Often, the people we call expats are those who have the greatest control over their expatriation experience. </blockquote>
				
			<p>Regarding race, Lemieux expresses her concern that certain issues are overlooked because "much of what is written about expatriation is written by white women (like me)..." and points to the example of how obtaining visas is easier for passport holders of European and North American countries. &nbsp;</p>

			<p><strong>The "Military BRAT" (BRAT) community</strong>, as represented in various social media outlets from Amazon to Facebook to Twitter, start to see BRAT-favorable changes as a result of a BRAT-led movement to maintain language used to name their identity growing up in December. &nbsp; TCKid covers details of the story in <a href="http://news.tckid.com/refusing-to-be-erased/">Refusing to Be Erased</a>, which connects how TCKs sometimes face skepticism about the TCK identity and experience to this BRAT-led movement. &nbsp; </p>

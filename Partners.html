		  	<!-- About Us -->
			<p>TCKid will update this page for verification of the identity of TCKid's partners, affiliations, collaborators for certain projects and staff. &nbsp;Please be informed that there may be similarly named organizations. TCKid is not affiliated with similarly named organizations unless they are listed below as a partner. One way to check is to make sure that the domain name of the site you are viewing is "TCKid.com" Any changes to TCKid's name or logo will also be updated here.</p>

			<br>

			<p>If you come across or are contacted by an individual or any organization who claims to represent us or be associated with us or uses our logo, but is NOT emailing from a TCKid.com domain (in the email address) or the website domain is not tckid.com, please notify us right away. If you have received emails or other communications from an individual instead of TCKid or an organization who seems to interchange their organization's name with TCKid's name or uses our logo please report it to us also at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:report@tckid.com">report@tckid.com</a>.</p>

			<br>
			
			<p>If you have been solicited or charged for donations, contributions, or sponsorships by an organization or individual that claims it will help TCKid, but is NOT TCKid, please contact us right away and cease your contributions. TCKid currently does not have any arrangement with an organization or individual to collect donations on behalf of TCKid. Fundraising drives in collaboration with the partners listed below will be announced ahead of time and involve management staff.</p>

			<br>
			
			<p>TCKid's current staff include Myra Dumapias, Chief Executive Officer and Erin Sinogba, Executive Assistant. TCKid's current board members are: Shannon Irby, Richard Klopp, Erin Sinogba and Myra Dumapias. These individuals are the only persons who are authorized to manage TCKid affairs, while operational management staff Myra Dumapias and Erin Sinogba are the only TCKid representatives authorized to accept donations for TCKid directly through <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=KC6E7XQWPMRFQ">TCKid's one and only PayPal account (please click here)</a>. &nbsp;Our <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=KC6E7XQWPMRFQ">Why Support Us</a> page leads to this sam<a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=KC6E7XQWPMRFQ">e PayPal account linked to "TCKid: A Home for Third Culture Kids."</a> Other volunteers may ask people to donate, but only through the<a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=KC6E7XQWPMRFQ"> "Why Support Us" page (click here)</a> or a fundraising drive announced by Myra or Erin, eg earlier ones on GoFundMe.</p>

			<br>
			
			<p>Local Group Leaders of TCKid's local groups around the world have been identified in each local group page, ie. "TCKid Philippines"/ "TCKid Sydney" on Facebook and will also be listed here in the future. &nbsp;TCKid Group Leaders are authorized to represent TCKid for engaging with the community and disseminating not for profit information about our organization, events, educational resources and other updates, as well as informing TCKid of its local group activities, requests and other interests so TCKid can accommodate for its local groups.</p>

			<h4>Recognized Partners of TCKid:</h4>

			<li><a href="http://culturs.guru/">Culturs</a>, The Global Multicultural Magazine</li>

			<li><a href="http://blog.crossculturalkid.org/">Cross Cultural Kid (Symposium)</a>&nbsp;with Ruth Van Reken</li>

			<br>
			<p>This list of recognized partners remains in effect until it is updated when additional partnerships are formed or if partnerships will be dissolved. &nbsp;Last updated September 4, 2014.</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<h4>Clarification on Previous Partnerships:</h4>

			<p>TCKid is a separate organization from and no longer has a joint venture partnership with TCK Academy officially as of January 1, 2013, and have never had a partnership with TCK Research or TCK World at least since the change of ownership (detailed below) in January, 2011. A joint venture with TCK Academy in the past helped TCKid with some of the operational expenses until December of 2011.&nbsp;&nbsp;This assistance was made possible with the help of Brice Royer, who is the sole owner of TCK Academy and founder of TCKid.com and the community forum for TCKs, for which we will always be grateful.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Brice Royer's vision and work that helped many TCK's discover their identity and find a sense of belonging at a time when social media at large was not yet representing the TCK story.</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<h4>New Programs Birthed under New Structure:</h4>

			<p>The new programs created under the management of Myra Dumapias with the assistance of Erin Sinogba includes TCKid TV and TCKid Research Bridge.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other programs still in development will soon be more formally announced.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These programs, as well as TCKid as an entity, have no association with or connection to any pre-January 2011 TCKid staff or partners, except for whom TCKid currently acknowledges as its current partners and staff. &nbsp; <a title="TCKid Programs and Information" href="http://news.tckid.com/tckid-programs-and-information/">Click here for more information about our programs</a>.</p>
